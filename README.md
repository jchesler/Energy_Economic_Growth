# Energy_Economic_Growth
A python project sourcing and analyzing energy and economic growth data
## Project Outline
Source data on my own and anaylze it using python. Data that was chosen looks at economic growth facotrs (GDP per Capita and percent of the population with access to electricity) and potential relationships to energy production from all countries.
## Key Questions and Objectives
- Is there a significant correlation between GDP and access to electricity?
- Is there a threshold of access to electricity that significantly increases a country’s GDP?
- Are there significant correlations between GDP and energy production from different sources?
- Which, if any, energy production type improves a country’s GDP the most from year to year.
- What are the trends of energy production from year to year, for each country?
- Do all countries follow the same trend?
- What countries are the top for energy production in fossil fuels, renewables and nuclear?
- What is the World’s GDP and how has it changed over time?
- Are there continents and regions that have a higher GDP than others?
- What role does electricity access and energy production play in that?
## Data
Analysis performed on data containing the following information
- country
- year
- percent of population with access to electricity
- gdp per capita
- percent of energy production from oil gas and coal (fossil fuels)
- percent of energy prodcution from nuclear sources
- percent of energy production from renewable sources
  Data source: All data was sourced from World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=1W&start=1998&view=chart)
